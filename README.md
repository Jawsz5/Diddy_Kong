The main objective of the game is to get our character (Diddy Kong) to the treasure without getting killed.
Diddy kong will have a health bar and if that goes to 0, the game is over.
If Diddy Kong gets hit by an enemy, he loses part of his health depending on the level chosen
If Diddy Kong falls into the ocean, he immediately loses all his health
